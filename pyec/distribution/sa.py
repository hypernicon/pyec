   size is greater than one, then this distribution maintains an array
   of accepted values, and can be used to run multiple concurrent
   markov chains.
   
   Config parameters
   
   * schedule -- The cooling schedule to use. May be any callable function, or
                 a string, one of ("log", "linear", "discount"). If it is a
                 callable, then it will be passed the ``updates`` value in
                 :class:`History` and should return a floating point value
                 that will divide the exponent in the Boltzmann distribution.
                 That is, ``schedule(n)`` should converge to zero as n goes to
                 infinity.
   * learningRate -- A divisor for the cooling schedule, used for built-in 
                     schedules "log" and "inear". As a divisor, it divides the
                     temperature but multiplies the exponent.
   * temp0 -- An initial temperature for the temperature decay in "discount"
   * restart -- A probability of restarting, tested at each update
   * divisor -- A divisor that divides the ``updates`` property of
                :class:`History`, scaling the rate of decline in the temperature
   * discount -- The decay factor for the built-in discount schedule; ``temp0``
                 is multiplied by ``discount`` once each time the ``update``
                 method is called
