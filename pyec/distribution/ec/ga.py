"""``SimpleGeneticAlgorithm`` uses proportional selection with one point
crossover and some mutation, all in a binary encoding such as provided by
``Binary`` and ``BinaryReal``.

The following definition says to use proportional selection twice (with the
second selection ignoring the results of the first, ``>> 1``),
followed by one-point crossover, followed by Bernoulli mutation (bit-flipping).
The genotype is set as :class:`BinaryReal` (the ``space``), which generates
bit strings and produces a Euclidean phenotype through the ``convert`` method
of :class:`BinaryReal`.
