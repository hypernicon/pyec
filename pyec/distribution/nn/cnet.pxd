cdef class RnnEvaluator:
    """A compiled RNN as a computable object. Takes a network in a form that
    is efficient to activate so that the network can be evaluated quickly.
    
    Produced by :class:`LayeredRnnGenotype`'s ``compile`` method.
    
    :param numNeurons: The number of neurons in the network, incl. bias, input,
                       output, and hidden
    :type numNeurons: ``int``
    :param inputs: A list of slices or indexes that can be applied to the
                   current state to set input values. The list should contain
                   one item per input layer, and each item should be capable
                   of being provided to ``__setitem__`` in order to set the
                   input values. So, for instance, an entry ``slice(5,10)``
                   at index ``2`` in the array would imply that the third
                   input layer state values are stored between the 5th and 10th
                   index in the state, and that the input layer contains
                   five values.
    :type inputs: A ``list`` of ``slice``s or ``int``s, potentially mixed
    :param outputs: A list of slices or indexes that can be applied to the
                    current state to extract output values. Like the structure
                    for ``inputs``, but used to retrieve outputs.
    :type outputs: A ``list`` of ``slice``s or ``int``s, potentially mixed
    :param weightStack: A list of lists of entries that apply the weights
                        of a neural network. Each entry contains a weight
                        matrix (``numpy.ndarray``), a ``slice`` indicating
                        the source indices, and a ``slice`` indicating the
                        target indices. Each nested list represents a set of
                        operations that may be performed concurrently, i.e.
                        that may be parallellized. Successive elements of the
                        outermost list must be performed serially.
    :type weightStack: A ``list`` of ``list``s each with a `tuple` containing
                       (``numpy.ndarray``, ``slice``, ``slice``)
    :param activationStack: A list of (``slice``,function) tuples that contains
                            the activation functions that must be applied for
                            each layer. The ``slice`` indicates the location of
                            the layer in the state array, and the function is
                            used to activate that portion of the state array.
